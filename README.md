## Purpose
This project was made to practice applying Java into an interactive chat application. I plan to embed this into a frontend framework to create something that could be utilized by users who need some sort of customer support.

## Running Application

1) Clone git repository

This can be done with command

```
git repo https://github.com/MeganTran6023/Java_ChatApp.git
```

2) Move into JavaChatApp_MT folder using cd 

3) Set up two terminals

* One terminal for client, second for server

4) Compile and run java files

```
1) Compile code

javac Server.java ChatClient.java


2) Run server one terminal

java Server

3) Run client another terminal

java ChatClient

```
