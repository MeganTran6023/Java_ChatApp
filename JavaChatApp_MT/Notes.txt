3/18 - Fixed bug

Issue was showing incorrect output where client side did not show server output
and server side had typo showing client message

How I fixed:

original code: output.println("Server:" + serverResponse);

this caused combo of CLient: Server: .... to output on server end

new code: System.out.println("Server: " + serverResponse);
